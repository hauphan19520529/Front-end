        Granny and grandpa have moved into a new old mansion with a moat and a high wall around it as protection .... or rather to make escape attempts more difficult.

        You are an explorer looking for new objects to explore when you see a seemingly abandoned mansion late one night.
        You take courage and open the unlocked gate and enter.
        What you do not know is an infamous couple living there who will do anything to keep you.

        Now you must try to escape from here.
        There are a lot of items placed inside and outside the house that you will have use for. You just need to figure out how to use them.
        But you have to be careful because Granny hears everything as usual and Grandpa also wanders around, but he does not hear very well, but if he sees you then it's best to run.
        As usual if you drop something on the floor or walking on a creaking floor Granny will start running to the place she heard that sound.
        You also need to watch out for her bear traps.
        You can hide under beds, a couch or in wardrobes but be careful that they do not see you when you are hiding.

        You can protect yourself from Granny and Grandpa using one of the two different types of weapons you can find in the house. But it only stops them for a while. But it's worth it.

        There are five different levels of difficulty.
        Extreme, Hard, Normal, Easy and Practice.
        If you play in Practice mode, you are in the house without Granny and Grandpa and you have the opportunity to try different things without major difficulties. But remember the house is not completely free from dangers.

        Granny and Grandpa gives you five days in the house.
        If you have failed to escape after the last day ... well, probably you can figure out what happens then.


        Good luck!

        Người chơi sẽ vào vai HUNK và đi thu thập mẫu vi rút loại G trên một con tàu hạng sang.
        Nghe có vẻ khá sai nhưng thật vậy, câu truyện trên đã có thể là diễn biến trong phần thứ ba của dòng game này khi cận kề ngày Sony ra mắt cổ máy PlayStation 2, game đã bị hủy, cuối cùng ta có Resident Evil 3 hiện tại với Jill Valentine là nhân vật chính được xem như một dự án dự phòng trong khi họ đang tập trung phát triển Resident Evil 4, được ra mắt chỉ sau hơn một năm ngày phát hành Resident Evil 2.
 
        Và cho đến hiện tại, cũng chỉ sau một năm ra mắt bản làm lại của phần game thứ hai, người chơi sẽ được đón nhận Resident Evil 3 Remake với nhiều thay đổi mới.
 
        Nhưng... liệu với những nỗ lực “cách tân” một tựa game hơn 20 năm tuổi của Capcom có thực sự thành công, đặc biệt là với cái bóng quá lớn của Resident Evil 2 Remake vừa qua có khiến cho phần game này bị phai nhạt?

            • Old School Adventure
            The Lightbringer draws a lot of inspiration from earlier Zelda games, and is all about invoking that feeling of wanting to explore every nook and cranny.
            
            • Semi-isometric Gameplay
            With a rotatable camera in an isometric view, you’ll need to look at things from many different angles in order to find solutions to your obstacles. Remember: There’s often more than meets the eye…
            
            • A poetic journey
            Your sister’s spirit guides your entire journey, narrating the gameplay entirely in verse.
            
            • Hazardous Dungeons
            Explore dark dungeons full of danger. Watch out for traps, secrets and that pesky slime!
